## Summary
This package contains domain files for a mock api of the Sociale verzekeringsbank. Together with their corresponding site files 
they make up a mock API  + admin panel of Sociale verzekeringsbank.

## Background
From an article of the Dutch Ombudsmen about the government and its relation with civilians one important conclusion was 
drawn. In summary the conclusion is that civilians would like to have a single point of contact when dealing with the 
government. When realizing such a scenario, several questions or problems arise such as how to deal with privacy, how 
could this be implemented, how to manage information streams, who will get access to what etc.

## Other systems
Several other mock api's are available, see the list below.

## Try / have a look
If you wish to have a look at the system, the API's are reachable trough the public internet or via 
[NlX](https://directory.demo.nlx.io/). The respective admin panels are also available on the public internet. Please 
contact us if you would like to peek around. We are happy to generate a login for you.

## Installation
If you wish to do your own installation, the best starting point would be to install the demo system. Instructions can 
be found here: 

## Een overheid / one government
In order to gain experience and be able to say something meaningful on this subject the (Novum Innovatie Lab)[https://novum.nu] started an 
experiment called “1 overheid”. In which a single government service would be fully realized utilizing mock API’s as the 
government services and have the communication follow the 
[common ground principles](https://commonground.nl/file/download/54476935/Common%20Ground%20Infographic.pdf) while 
utilizing [NlX](https://nlx.io/) as a secure layer for intra governmental data exchanges.  

## Contribute
It would be great if we could make these systems more realistic in terms of data and datamodel or extend it's 
functionality. Please feel free to submit a pull request or contact us whenever you feel like doing a contribution in 
any way.
